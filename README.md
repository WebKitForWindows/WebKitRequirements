# WebKitRequirements
> Third party packages required for building the open source WebKit port for Windows.

> [!WARNING]  
> ## ðŸš§ REPOSITORY UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION! ðŸš§
>
> The Windows WebKit port has an influx of new contributors and interests.
> Feedback from that group identified some friction around managing third party
> libraries. To support that community's efforts the direction of this
> repository is changing.
>
> Going forward `vcpkg` will be directly integrated in the Windows WebKit port.
> The third party libraries will be built there through the canonical
> [registry](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) with this registry providing
> overlays of ports from it when absolutely necessary.
>
> At this time this repository is not accepting any changes from the community.
> It will reopen after the transition is completed.
